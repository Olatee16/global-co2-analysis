# üåç Global CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis (1960‚Äì2011)

**Objective:** To explore global CO‚ÇÇ emissions over time using World Bank data, with a focus on both **per capita emissions (by country)** and **total production (by region)** to identify sustainability challenges and opportunities.

**Tools:** Tableau, Excel  
**Skills showcased:** Data integration, trend analysis, geospatial visualization, dashboard storytelling

## What I built
- **Map visualization** of average CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita by country (2000‚Äì2011).  
- **Time-series visualization** of total CO‚ÇÇ emissions by world region (1960‚Äì2011).  
- Dashboards combining country-level and regional-level insights for policymakers and researchers.

---

## Key takeaways
- Global CO‚ÇÇ emissions are highly uneven across regions and countries.  
- East Asia & Pacific has emerged as the **leading contributor** in recent decades.  
- North America remains a **high emitter**, while Europe shows signs of **declining emissions**.  
- Sustainability requires **global cooperation** ‚Äî developed economies must lead on clean energy, while emerging economies must balance growth with sustainability.  

---

## Key insights
1. **Economic development drives emissions** ‚Äî industrial growth correlates with sharp increases.  
2. **Emissions are unevenly distributed** ‚Äî some regions contribute disproportionately while others remain low.  
3. **Policy & business action are critical** ‚Äî balancing growth with sustainability will define future emissions pathways.
